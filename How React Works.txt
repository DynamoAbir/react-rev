React Started at 2013. it's old name is faxjs.
React actually bring 2 script with it. 
1. React
2. React Dom

React: React genarate HTML
React-Dom: will render in dom (in Root)

            HOW TO USE

to use react we will take the rootdiv using querySelector("ROOT")

ReactDom.render()--- ReactDom.render() will take 2 perameter. First
perameter will take "What to render" and 2nd one will take "where to render"
which is the root element.

react gives us some usefull function one of them is createElement().
createElement()- will take 3 pera meter "what to create","what is property,
"what should be inside the element" .. example given below

const myElemnet=react.createElement("div",null,"Hello world");
if we want to render anything inside that element we will pass it into the 
third perameter.

whatever we insert in {} in react its called interpolation
